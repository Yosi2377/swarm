## Level 8 System — Ready for Testing

### What was built today:
1. **`swarm/delegate.sh`** — Full delegation wrapper: auto-injects lessons + skills into agent prompts. Usage: `bash swarm/delegate.sh <agent> "task" "keywords"`
2. **`swarm/inject-lessons.sh`** — TF-IDF search over lessons.json, returns top 5 relevant lessons. 0 tokens (bash only)
3. **`swarm/self-improve.sh`** — 5 bash checks: patterns, production health, CSS selectors, lesson quality, sandbox sync. 0 tokens
4. **`swarm/cron-self-improve.sh`** — Wrapper for cron, writes /tmp/watchdog-alert.json only when issues found
5. **Cron jobs**: `self-improve-morning` (10:00) + `self-improve-evening` (22:00) — bash only, agent wakes only on alert
6. **Lesson cleanup**: 122 → 57 lessons (removed eval fail spam + duplicates)
7. **Browser tests updated**: betting.json with correct selectors (featured-match, odd-btn, bet-slip, sidebar-left)
8. **Koder scores updated**: +5 successes (basketball, soccer, tennis, watched events, bet delay) → score 56%, streak +5

### Level 8 Status:
- Infrastructure: ✅ READY
- Tested in production: ⏳ PENDING — next task from Yossi will be the real test
- delegate.sh flow: task → inject-lessons → inject-skills → sessions_spawn → learn.sh score
- Token budget rule: cron = bash only, agent only when alert. No background token burn.

### Next Step:
Yossi wants to test the system with a real task. When new session starts, continue from here — run the task through delegate.sh and verify the full Level 8 flow works.
