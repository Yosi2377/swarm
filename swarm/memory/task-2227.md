# Task 2227 — Status: DONE

## Changes Made
1. **admin.html** — Added "זכיות" and "רווח/הפסד" columns to users table. Backend aggregates wins/profit from Bet collection.
2. **Settlement Engine** — Root cause: aggregator marked events completed but never published `event:settled` to Redis. Fixed by adding Redis publisher to aggregator + 2-minute auto-settle in backend.
3. **index.html** — Admin sees all bets via `/api/bets/all` endpoint. User filter dropdown, void button (refunds), edit status button. Username shown on each card.

## Files Changed
- `aggregator/src/index.js` — Redis publisher + event:settled publishing
- `backend/src/routes/admin.js` — Users endpoint now includes bet stats aggregate
- `backend/src/routes/bets.js` — New endpoints: GET /all, POST /:id/void, PUT /:id
- `backend/public/admin.html` — New columns in users table
- `backend/public/index.html` — Admin bets view with controls
- `backend/src/index.js` — Auto-settle interval every 2 minutes
