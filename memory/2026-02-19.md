## Production Deploy (Topic 4950)
- Deployed 11 files from sandbox → production (BettingPlatform)
- Files: index.html, admin.html, live.html, superagent.html, settlement.js, index.js, Bet.js, User.js, admin.js, auth.js, bets.js
- Handled immutable flags (chattr -i/+i)
- Backup: `/root/BettingPlatform/backups-20260219-071515/`
- Features deployed: lineLevel (1-36), buying power, manual bet settlement

## Context Optimization
- Reduced workspace files from 20.6K → 6.3K bytes (69% reduction)
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md (no longer needed)
- Slimmed AGENTS.md from 11.3K → 1.4K (swarm instructions load on-demand via ORCHESTRATOR.md/SYSTEM.md)
- Slimmed MEMORY.md from 3.9K → 0.9K (removed old Unity/Blackjack details)
- New sessions start ~15K context instead of ~29K

## Babysitter-Inspired Pipeline Upgrade
- Researched github.com/a5c-ai/babysitter (orchestration framework for Claude Code)
- Implemented 3 features into our swarm pipeline:
  1. **Quality Convergence** — `swarm/quality-gate.sh` scores tasks (0-1.0), retries up to 3x if < 0.7
  2. **Event Journal** — `swarm/journal.sh` writes events to `swarm/runs/<task-id>/journal/`
  3. **Resumable Runs** — `pipeline.sh --resume <task-id>` continues from last step
- Learning system integrated: lessons recorded per iteration, errors fed back
