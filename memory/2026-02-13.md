# 2026-02-13 — Research + Sandbox + Enforcement

## Swarm Research (topic 1368)
- Worker agent researched CrewAI, AutoGen, MetaGPT, ChatDev, LangGraph
- Finding: 3-5 agents is optimal (we have 5 = sweet spot)
- Enhanced agents.json to v4: added description, backstory, constraints, keywords
- Auto-routing algorithm added to ORCHESTRATOR.md
- Shared memory protocol: swarm/memory/shared/
- Vault created: swarm/memory/vault/

## Sandbox Environment (topic 1394)
- Yossi's idea: clone project to sandbox before changes, work there, apply back if success
- sandbox.sh built with create/test/apply/destroy commands
- Port mapping for each project (production → sandbox)

## Enforcement System (topic 1443)
- Problem: agents don't follow protocols (no sandbox, no screenshots, no review)
- Solution: enforce.sh with pre-work/post-work/review/check-sandbox
- SYSTEM.md shortened from 250+ to ~60 lines — 3 iron rules only
- Orchestrator enforces via enforce.sh at each step

## Poker: All-In Animation (topic 1426)
- Bug: all cards revealed simultaneously during all-in
- Fix needed: reveal player cards first, then flop one by one, turn, river
- Testing requires 2 users connected simultaneously

## Pending Topics (waiting for Yossi approval):
- Topic 883: שדרוגים - הרשאות, גיבוי, דוחות, rating, cancel, timeout
- Topic 906: Dashboard real-time update
- Topic 1065: שדרוג סוכנים v3 - Plan Review, Quality Gates, Workflows
- Topic 1426: פוקר All-In animation
