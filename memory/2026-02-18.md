# 2026-02-18 — Major Session

## Swarm System Levels 5.5-7.0
- Built scan-bugs.sh (Level 5.5), projects.json + project-task.sh (Level 6.0), evolve.sh (Level 6.5), spawn-agent.sh (Level 7.0)
- Meta-agent test: spawned SEO agent → added schema.org structured data → deployed
- 15 deploys today, 0 rollbacks

## Cron Jobs → Bash Watchdog (CRITICAL CHANGE)
- **Removed all 7 AI cron jobs** — they burned Claude Max tokens (1,440+ AI calls/day!)
- Archived in `swarm/crons-archive/` (7 JSON files) for future restore
- **Replaced with `swarm/watchdog.sh`** — pure bash, systemd timer every 60s, 0 tokens
- Watchdog checks: services, HTTP, disk, MongoDB, stale odds, JS errors, 404s
- If bash finds code bug → writes `/tmp/watchdog-alert.json` → sends cron wake → AI fixes
- systemd: `watchdog.timer` + `watchdog.service`

## ZozoBet Fixes
### New Markets Added
- 9 markets in popup: alt_totals, result_totals, btts_h1/h2, double_chance_h1, correct_score_h1, result_btts, ten_min_result, specials
- Backend: cards_total, both_teams_cards, player_shots, player_shots_on_target, goalkeeper_saves, betboost, goals_range, alt_corners, total_corners, team_corners
- Frontend: 🃏 Cards tab, 🚀 BetBoost tab, player shots in Players tab, goals range in Goals tab

### Tennis Odds Bug Fixed
- Was showing 1st_set_winner odds as h2h instead of to_win_match
- Fix: `to_win_match` gets priority over `full_time_result` in betsapi.js

### Basketball/Tennis Live Odds Fixed
- inplay_filter API returns empty odds for basketball/tennis
- But `/v3/bet365/event` endpoint returns full MG/PA data (30 MGs, 345 PAs for basketball!)
- Bug: `liveOddsUpdatedAt` field didn't exist → query `$lt` didn't match
- Fix: added `$or` with `$exists: false` and `null` check
- Also increased limit from 5 to 8 events per cycle

### Quarter/Set Locking
- Added detection of current quarter (basketball) and current set (tennis)
- Past quarters/sets show 🔒 with "שוק סגור" message

### Odds Rotation Fix
- 291 events with `odds: undefined` were never entering rotation
- Set `oddsUpdatedAt` to old date to force them into queue
- Batch-fixed: 35 basketball + 35 tennis events got prematch odds

### Pipeline Improvements
- gen-tests.sh: SKIP_CLASSES for dynamic selectors, MAX=10
- pipeline.sh: posts task details + progress + screenshot inside topic (was empty before)
- pipeline.sh: auto-injects lessons before task, auto-learns from failures after

## Feedback Loop (evolve.sh)
- Analyzes pipeline success rate
- Deduplicates lessons (found 25 duplicates, cleaned 130→105)
- Auto-fixes: reduced MAX_TESTS when tests-partial is common
- Agent performance scores by agent name

## Key Yossi Preferences (learned today)
- **Don't burn tokens** — bash for monitoring, AI only when needed
- **Screenshots required** — always show visual proof
- **Honest about capabilities** — don't overclaim system abilities
- **Sandbox first, approve for production** — Level B autonomy
