# Task 1547 - Card Animation Fix (Poker)

## Status: BUILD COMPLETE - Ready for testing
## Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes Made (ONLY in game.vue)
1. **actionComplete handler (~line 437)**: Flop (3 new cards) revealed one-by-one with 500ms delay. Turn/River immediate.
2. **gameOver handler (~line 470)**: All-in scenario: reveal player hands first (with Vue reactivity via spread/map), wait 1s, then reveal community cards one-by-one with 500ms, then show winner/income.
3. **finishGameOver method added** (~line 265): Helper to set winner + income after all-in card reveal sequence.
4. **Type fix**: `commonCard` typed as `string[]` instead of inferred `never[]`.

## What was NOT changed
- Winner message timing unchanged
- Income animation unchanged  
- CSS unchanged
- gameOver cleanup logic (clearTimeout, actionUserId) unchanged
- newGame/init flow unchanged

## Build
- `npx vue-cli-service build` → SUCCESS
- Copied dist to server/app/public/
