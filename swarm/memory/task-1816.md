# Task 1816 — Match Detail Modal (Betting Platform)

**Date**: 2026-02-14
**Status**: ✅ Done
**Agent**: Koder (⚙️)

## What was built
- **Match Detail Modal** on `live.html` (sandbox: port 9089)
- Click any match row or `+N` button → opens modal overlay
- Modal has 3 tabs: **1X2**, **Over/Under**, **Spreads**
- 1X2 tab: shows 1, X, 2 buttons + Double Chance (estimated)
- Over/Under tab: main line + nearby alternative lines (±0.5, ±1)
- Spreads tab: home/away spread with point values
- Clicking any odd in modal → adds to bet slip (same as main table)
- ESC or click outside → closes modal
- Tabs auto-disable when data is unavailable
- Dark theme matching site design

## Files modified
- `/root/sandbox/BettingPlatform/backend/public/live.html` — added modal CSS, HTML, JS

## Bug fixed
- `const eid` was referenced before declaration in render loop (moved declaration earlier)

## Notes
- Existing API `GET /api/events/:eventId` already returns full odds — no new backend endpoint needed
- DB stores single best odds per market (not multiple bookmakers)
- Alternative O/U lines are estimated from main line using probability adjustment
