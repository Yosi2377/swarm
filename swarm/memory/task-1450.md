# Task 1450: פוקר - קלפים נפתחים אחד אחד

## Status: sandbox ready, needs testing
## Agent: koder
## Project: /root/TexasPokerGame (sandbox: /root/sandbox/TexasPokerGame)

## Changes Made

### Fix 1: Flop cards staggered reveal
- **File**: `client/src/views/game.vue` - `actionComplete` handler
- **Problem**: Server sends 3 flop cards at once, client sets `this.commonCard` immediately
- **Fix**: When new cards > 1 (flop), reveal them one by one with 600ms delay between each

### Fix 2: All-in player hands Vue reactivity  
- **File**: `client/src/views/game.vue` - `gameOver` handler
- **Problem**: `p.handCard = winner.handCard` doesn't trigger Vue 2 reactivity (property wasn't reactive)
- **Fix**: Create new player objects with spread operator, reassign entire `this.players` array

### Fix 3: Card flip animation timing
- **File**: `client/src/components/CardList.vue`
- **Change**: Reduced animation-delay from 1s to 0.5s for snappier feel

## Build
- `npm install` + `npx vue-cli-service build` in client/
- Copied dist/ to server/app/public/
- Ready to apply to production after testing
